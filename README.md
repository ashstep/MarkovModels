## Markov Models

### General Information: 
- Markov processes are used widely in Computer Science and in analyzing different forms of data.  
- This project uses a Markov process to generate random text based on a training text.
- Interestingly, if to be run in reverse in a further implementation, the source of a text could be detected (based on frequencies of letters and words).
- This program was tested with JUnit tests.
